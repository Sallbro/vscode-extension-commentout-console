## Overview

**Comment Console Logs** is a Visual Studio Code extension that helps developers quickly comment out all `console.log` statements in their project. This can be useful for debugging purposes, cleanup before pushing code to production, or simply reducing clutter in your codebase.

## Features

- Automatically comment out all `console.log` statements in your project.
- Preserves leading whitespace and indentation.
- Skips `console.log` statements that are already commented.
- Works with both JavaScript (`.js`) and TypeScript (`.ts`) files.

### Example:

Before running the extension:

```typescript
console.log("This is a log message");
const a = 10;
console.log("Another log message");
```
